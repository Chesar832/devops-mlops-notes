Let's talk about some concepts before jump into the practical part of applying commands to really understand them.

**ðŸ§  First: What is a host?**
A host is just a computer or device connected to a network.
- Your laptop? â†’ A host.
- A server? â†’ A host.
- A router? â†’ Also a host (with extra functions).

ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s any device that can send or receive data over a network.

**ðŸ§© Second: What is a network interface?**
A network interface is the thing on your host that connects it to a network.

There are different types:

| Interface Type | Example Name | Description |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Ethernet       | eth0, enp3s0 | Wired connection port |
| Wi-Fi          | wlan0        | Wireless connection |
| Loopback       | lo           | Internal-only, for testing (127.0.0.1) |
| Virtual        | docker0, veth1234 | Virtual links created by tools like Docker, Mininet |

ðŸ‘‰ So if a host is the whole machine, a network interface is like one of its "network ports".

Now, we can talk about connect hosts without misunderstandings!

To connect two systems (hosts), we need a switch that can be connected locally or virtually to both systems, creating a network. To connect one system to the switch (network), we need an interface (physical or virtual depending on the host) on both hosts. For Linux, we can use the `ip link` command to manage network interfaces. 

A network interface is a point of interconnection between a computer and a network, allowing the computer to communicate over the network. The `ip link` command is used to display and modify network interfaces, providing a way to manage the connections between the systems and the network.

ðŸ‘‰ **Linux ip Command Syntax**
The ip command accepts objects (subcommands), options, and additional arguments, allowing users to configure and manage network interfaces, routes, tunneling, etc. Below is the basic command syntax:

```bash
ip [option] [subcommand] [arguments]
```

The following list introduces the most frequently used ip command objects:

- `link (l)` configures network interfaces.
- `address (addr/a)` modifies protocol addresses (IP, IPv6).
- `route (r)` alters routing tables.
- `neigh (n)` manipulates neighbor objects.

Consider that the hosts do not need to share exactly the same network interface; they just need to have one that can connect to the network and is compatible with the network's communication protocol. For example, two computers can have different types of network interfaces, such as a WiFi card and an Ethernet port, and still communicate because both interfaces are compatible with the protocol of a WiFi router.

So, we'll use a command to see our available network's interfaces:

```bash
ip link

>> eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
>> link/ether c4:3d:1a:aa:ea:ba brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
>> altname eth0s20f3

```

Then, we add a network to our network interface:
> The `addr` option isn't creating or adding a whole network, it just connecting our host to the specified existing network.

```bash
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
```
**What does this command do?**
- `ip addr add`: Command to add a new IP address.
- `192.168.1.10/24`: The IP address you are assigning, with subnet mask /24 (which means 255.255.255.0).
- `dev eth0`: Apply this configuration to the network device/interface called eth0. Here, `dev` is a keyword which stands for *"device"*.

So, now we can **share and receive info across the network** whose ip we pass to the `ip addr add` command.
